On this mini website, you can find a series of student blog posts that originated during our Master's class "Research on Corporate Transparency", which we ran at the [School of Business and Economics](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/mainpage) at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) in the summer term of 2025.

The course in general and our blog theme of disinformation in particular were inspired by the research program of the [TRR 266 Accounting for Transparency](https://www.accounting-for-transparency.de), which is founded by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](https://www.dfg.de/en). 

The blog posts presented here are as submitted by the students, and their content remains in the responsibility of the respective authors. Any feedback can be send to the course instructor [Joachim Gassen](mailto:gasssen@wiwi.hu-berlin.de). Enjoy!
