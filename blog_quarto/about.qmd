This student blog is the result of a course on corporate transparency, instructed by [Joachim Gassen](mailto:gassen@wiwi.hu-berlin.de), which we ran in the summer of 2025 at the [School of Business and Economics](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/mainpage)</a> at [Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin](https://hu-berlin.de>).

The content of the course was centered around the research program of the [TRR 266 Accounting for Transparency](https://accounting-for-transparency.de), which is funded by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](https://dfg.de).

The blog posts presented here are as submitted by the students, and their content remains in the responsibility of the respective authors.
