    "text": "Imagine choosing cancer treatments based on a Facebook post or rejecting vaccines because of a viral TikTok video. Health misinformation isn’t just annoying–it’s dangerous. During COVID-19, false claims about bleach cures and 5G conspiracies demonstrated how quickly bad science spreads. But why do some people believe these claims while others don’t? A groundbreaking systematic review in Social Science & Medicine (Nan, Wang, & Thier, 2022) analyzed 61 studies with nearly 200,000 participants to answer this exact question."

    "text": "The Four Psychological Pathways to Vulnerability\nThe researchers developed an integrative psychological model showing how susceptibility flows through four cognitive channels:\n\nAbility to Reason Accurately\nPeople with strong health literacy, subject knowledge, or numeracy skills are better equipped to evaluate claims. For example, understanding how vaccines work makes you 90% less likely to believe anti-vax misinformation (Govender et al., 2017).\nAccuracy-Motivated Reasoning\nThose who pause to analyze claims resist misinformation best. Those preferring analytical processing over intuitive thinking are less vulnerable. Individuals scoring high on cognitive reflection tests were 3x less likely to accept COVID conspiracies (Nurse et al., 2021).\nDirectionally-Motivated Reasoning\nWe often believe what feels true. People often accept claims aligning with pre-existing beliefs (political/religious) or emotional states (anxiety). Conspiracy thinkers are 68% more susceptible to health misinformation, while conservatives and highly religious individuals show elevated risk due to confirmation bias (Uscinski et al., 2020).\nIdentity-Motivated Reasoning\nGroup identities (political affiliation, national identity) shape belief formation. When group loyalty trumps truth, susceptibility spikes. Republican identifiers were 40% more likely to believe pandemic falsehoods than Democrats (Motta, 2021).\n\nThis framework explains why misinformation resistance isn’t just about intelligence-it’s about how we process information.\nTable 1: Psychological Shields and Vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtective Factors\nRisk Factors\nStrength of Evidence\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical thinking\nConspiracy thinking\n★★★★★ (7 studies)\n\n\nHealth/science literacy\nConservative ideology\n★★★★☆ (15 studies)\n\n\nTrust in scientists\nReligiosity\n★★★★☆ (14 studies)\n\n\nSubject knowledge\nTrust in friends/family*\n★★★☆☆ (9 studies)\n\n\n\n*As primary information sources"

The review uncovered striking patterns:\n\nRacial minorities face disproportionate risk: African Americans were 50% more likely to believe vaccine misinformation, Hispanic Americans 35% more (Austin et al., 2021). This likely stems from historical medical exploitation and healthcare inequities.\nSocial media dependence is the strongest behavioral predictor. Those sourcing health information from social platforms were 4.2x more susceptible than those using scientific sources (Lee et al., 2020).\nEducation and age offer partial protection: 70% of studies found college education reduces susceptibility, while 60% showed seniors resist misinformation better than youth-likely due to media literacy and life experience.\n\nTable 2: Demographic Susceptibility Patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nRisk Level\nKey Contributing Factors\n\n\n\n\nSocial media reliant\nHigh\nAlgorithmic bubbles, rapid sharing\n\n\nRacial minorities\nHigh\nMedical mistrust, information access\n\n\nYouth (18-30)\nModerate\nLess life experience, digital natives\n\n\nLow health literacy\nModerate\nDifficulty evaluating sources"

    "text": "2.Behavior Pattern of South Korean Disinformation Campaign\n\n2.1 Timing Pattern\nFigure 1 illustrates the temporal behavior of NIS accounts compared to regular users. The differences reveal a structured, workday schedule pattern—suggesting the activity was carried out by agents operating on assigned schedules rather than ordinary social media users.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Timing pattern\n\n\n\nFrom panel (a), we can clearly observe that NIS accounts were more active during regular working hours, while their activity dropped significantly after office hours. In contrast, regular users were more active after working hours.\nPanel (b) shows NIS activity drops sharply on Saturdays and Sundays, while regular users actually become more active.\nPanel ( c ) suggests the NIS tweet suddenly stop their tweeting after they were discovered on December 11.\n\n\nBy using the office-hour activity pattern, the researchers were able to identify and validate 824 additional suspicious NIS accounts.\n\n\n\n2.2 Message Amplification Strategies\n\n2.2.1 Retweeting Within the Network\nRetweeting refers to one account retweeting within the same group or agent.Up to 48% of retweets were made within the NIS network. The density and darkness of connections in the retweet network highlight this varied pattern—some agents showed strong internal coordination, while others retweeted inconsistently.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Retweet Pattern\n\n\nIn panel (a), the larger nodes represents accounts that received more retweets from other NIS accounts; the darker it appears, the higher the percentage of its retweets within the NIS network. This structure reveals targeted amplification rather than organic engagement.\nFrom panel (b), we can see more clear srtucture of the retweeting strategy. From clusters(highlighted in yellow), the agents 7, 15, 16 and 19 created one or two central accounts, retweeting within themselves. While other agents show a coordinated strategy, retweeting each other.\n\n\n2.2.2 Co-tweeting: Copy-Paste Tweets\nCo-tweeting refers to multiple accounts posting identical content within short time windows. Researchers found that 85% of these co-tweets occurred within one minute, and 99% within a typical 10-hour workday—indicating highly disciplined timing.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Co-tweeting Network\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the co-tweeting network of NIS accounts. Each node represents an account, and edges connect accounts that posted the same message within a short time window. Rather than forming one large connected network, the accounts are divided into small clusters. This suggests that agents operated independently, each managing their own set of accounts.\nThe two dense clusters—labeled (1) and (2)—show groups of accounts assigned to agents 4 and 29, respectively. Each cluster reveals accounts acting like a copy-paste unit, posting identical tweets in parallel. These clusters are internally dense but disconnected from each other, reinforcing the decentralized structure of the campaign.\n\nThis copy-paste pattern became a powerful detection strategy: accounts that co-tweeted repeatedly and tightly clustered around known agents were flagged as highly suspicious.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Co-Retweeting: Coordinated Sharing of the Same Content\nCo-retweeting occurs when multiple accounts retweet the same tweet within a short time window. In this campaign, only 17% of retweets were unique—most were repeated. Although co-retweets were more temporally dispersed than co-tweets, 20% occurred within one minute and 99% within a week—suggesting sustained, low-profile coordination.\n\nThough 440 co-retweeters were flagged as bot-like after manual review, co-retweeting patterns helped narrow down potential campaign accounts."

    "text": "Whether it’s promoting equality, saving the planet or just being honest with their customers, companies love to talk big. But what happens when they don’t live up to their promises?\nOne striking example is the Volkswagen emissions scandal of 2015. VW ran bold advertising campaigns promoting its diesel cars as clean and environmentally friendly, promising drivers they could go green without giving up power according to BBC, 2015.\nTurns out, it was all a smokescreen, literally. VW later admitted to installing software that cheated emissions tests. Their vehicles were emitting up to 40 times the legal limit in the US. People weren’t just upset about the fraud, they felt misled by a brand that had promised better. This is a classic case of moral hypocrisy. But it’s only one of the three forms corporate hypocrisy can take: moral, behavioral and attributional.\n\n\nBefore diving into the types of corporate hypocrisy, Fig. 1 provides an overview of how company actions can lead to perceptions of hypocrisy and ultimately trigger stakeholder reactions.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. How Corporate Hypocrisy Unfolds\n\n\nAccording to Wagner, Korschun and Troebs (2020), corporate hypocrisy can take three main forms: moral, behavioral and attributional. To come up with this framework, they combined ideas from psychology, business and marketing to better understand how people react when companies don’t live up to what they project. Here’s how they break it down:\nMoral hypocrisy is defined as “the belief that a firm is trying to appear more virtuous than it is”. In simpler terms, it’s when people feel that a company is just putting on a good face. For example, imagine a fast fashion brand launching a supposedly sustainable collection filled with green messaging, but actually, only a small percentage of the materials used are eco-friendly.\nBehavioral hypocrisy refers to “the belief that statements made by a firm deviate from its demonstrated behavior”. In other words, people believe the company says one thing but does another. A common example would be a company that claims to be committed to reducing plastic waste, yet continues to use single-use plastic for all its packaging.\nFinally, hypocrisy attributions are defined as “an individual’s personal judgement that a firm is hypocritical by its nature”. Put simply, it’s when someone sees a company as fundamentally fake. For instance, if a firm repeatedly faces scandals (greenwashing, exploitative labor, etc.), people may come to believe that the brand’s entire identity is insincere.\nEssentially, these perceptions are triggered by antecedents such as deceptive practices and behavioral inconsistency. The former refers to situations where a company deliberately says or does things to give people the wrong idea, whether it’s customers, employees or the public. The VW scandal is a good example. The latter happens when a company’s actions and messages don’t quite match, but not necessarily on purpose. It could just be due to poor coordination or unclear priorities.\nThese perceptions can lead to three main types of reactions: emotional, behavioral and cognitive. Emotionally, stakeholders may feel intense responses, often negative, such as anger or disgust, though sometimes even empathy. Behaviorally, they might respond by distancing themselves from the company or actively pushing back. Cognitively, the inconsistency can create mental tension, prompting people to think more critically and seek out more information to make sense of what they’ve seen.\n\n\n\nWe already mentioned the Volkswagen scandal, but it’s not the only story out there. Another big one involves fast-fashion giant H&M. In 2022, the brand was accused of misleading customers with environmental “scorecards” — tags that were supposed to show how sustainable each clothing item was. But many of those claims were way off. H&M ran a huge marketing campaign that made its products seem much greener than they really were. They also promoted a clothing take-back program, saying old clothes would be fully recycled into new ones. In reality, a lot of those clothes still ended up in landfills (The Sustainable Fashion Forum). According to Quartz, over half of H&M’s sustainability labels either overstated the benefits or were completely false. In some cases, they even showed the opposite of what was true. No surprise, people felt misled. This is another clear case of moral hypocrisy, when a company tries to look more virtuous than it really is.\n\n\n\nWagner et al. (2020) weren’t the first to look at corporate hypocrisy. Earlier research by Wagner, Lutz, and Weitz (2009) and by Scheidler, Edinger-Schons, Spanjol, and Achleitner (2019) had already explored how people react when companies say one thing and do another, especially when it comes to social responsibility. Shim and Yang (2016) also looked into how a company’s reputation and crises influence these perceptions. But each field, from psychology to marketing to management, seemed to define hypocrisy a little differently. What Wagner and his colleagues did was bring all these pieces together. They created a clearer, more unified way to understand how and why people call out companies for being fake.\nTheir work has real-life implications for both companies and consumers. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just a trend, it’s a real and growing concern. Understanding how people interpret corporate behavior is crucial, especially when expectations are high. Even well-intentioned actions can backfire if they are perceived as deceptive or inconsistent. Future research could build on this by exploring how cultural context, digital transparency, or industry-specific norms shape these perceptions of hypocrisy. It could also test how companies can rebuild trust after being seen as hypocritical.\n\n\n\nWagner, Tillmann, Daniel Korschun, and Cord-Christian Troebs (2020): Deconstructing Corporate Hypocrisy: A Delineation of Its Behavioral, Moral, and Attributional Facets.

Even well-intentioned actions can backfire if they are perceived as deceptive or inconsistent. Future research could build on this by exploring how cultural context, digital transparency, or industry-specific norms shape these perceptions of hypocrisy. It could also test how companies can rebuild trust after being seen as hypocritical."

    "title": "Beyond the Numbers: The Hidden Influence of Earnings Management",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When we hear about accounting disinformation, we often think of outright lies, fraud, or other clear violations of trust. But in accounting disinformation can take on a more subtle and strategic form of earnings management. This practice enables companies to shape the presentation of financial performance while staying within the boundaries of legal accounting standards.\nHealy and Wahlen (1999) define earnings management as the intentional use of judgment in financial reporting and transaction structuring to influence how performance is portrayed. The goal is either to mislead stakeholders about the firm’s economic condition or to affect outcomes tied to accounting figures, such as contracts or compensation.\nEarnings management can be illustrated with a following example. Consider a company that sells products on credit and must estimate how many customers won’t pay their bills. To account for these expected losses, companies set aside a certain amount, known as a bad debt allowance. Management uses its judgment to determine this amount. In a year with lower profits, they might slightly reduce the allowance, assuming better-than-usual customer repayment, which boosts reported earnings without breaking any rules, as the estimate remains within a justifiable range. Yet, the result is a more favorable portrayal of the company’s performance.\nCompanies manage earnings for several strategic reasons, which include meeting analyst forecasts to maintain investor confidence or presenting a stable predictable performance (Burgstahler and Eames, 1998). Managing profits can also improve solvency metrics, thereby reducing reported credit risk and securing access to more favorable contractual terms (Watts and Zimmerman, 1978).\nWhile such practices remain legal when they are based on reasonable judgment, they raise concerns about financial transparency and the potential to mislead stakeholders. Since earnings adjustments often rely on subjective estimates, they are difficult to detect, keeping the issue a persistent topic of debate in both regulatory and academic circles. Existing research explores why and when earnings management occurs, how it affects capital markets, and which techniques companies use to manage earnings (Healy and Wahlen, 1999).\nOne study that touches on several of these aspects is the widely cited paper by Burgstahler and Dichev (1997). Building on the broadly supported idea that companies have strong incentives to avoid reporting bad performance, the study examines whether firms alter their accounting numbers to avoid reporting small losses or declines in earnings.\nTo detect earnings management, authors apply a distributional analysis. They assume that without manipulation, the distribution of reported earnings follows a smooth, bell-shaped curve. Most firms cluster around moderate profitability levels, while fewer firms report larger losses or profits. Crucially, in this case the distribution curve is continuous without any sudden jumps, particularly around zero earnings. Accordingly, firms with small negative earnings appear with similar frequency as those with small positive earnings.\nIn contrast, if firms systematically manage away losses, this smooth pattern breaks down. Companies with small pre-managed losses may shift earnings just enough to report a small profit instead. As a result, the distribution shows a discontinuity with an unusually low number of firms with earnings just below zero and a spike just above. This pattern signals that some firms are nudging their earnings upwards to avoid the negative signal of reporting losses.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe findings of the study reveal a distribution that is relatively smooth except the critical area near zero, where the continuous pattern breaks. Firms reporting small losses appear less frequently than expected, while those reporting earnings just above zero are unusually common. This discontinuity at the zero-profit threshold is not only visually striking but also statistically significant. Formal tests confirm that the dip in small losses and the spike in small profits, affecting more than 30% of firms with slightly negative pre-managed earnings, cannot be attributed to random variation or chance.\nCrucially, these earnings shifts are not just minor technicalities. Firms adjust their figures by more than 1% of their market value, enough to noticeably change how their performance appears. The pressure to meet expectations, signal financial health, and avoid negative market reactions drives companies to manipulate their earnings to stay on the “right” side of zero.\n\n\n\nFigure2\n\n\nThe consequences of earnings management go beyond accounting. Earnings manipulation undermines the reliability of financial reports, potentially resulting in poor investment decisions, mispriced securities, and unfair contractual terms (Healy and Wahlen, 1999)). Ultimately, widespread earnings management undermines trust in financial markets and can increase the cost of capital for all firms (Strobl, 2013)). To combat these risks, regulators set stricter accounting standards to reduce room for managerial judgment, auditors review financial statements to detect signs of manipulation, analysts scrutinize company reports, looking for unusual patterns.\nHowever, despite advancements in accounting standards and regulatory oversight, earnings management did not turn to a historical artefact. Even today, the pattern uncovered by Burgstahler and Dichev continues affecting financial reporting. The figure below demonstrates this, replicating the original analysis using a sample of Berlin-based firms for the recent years. The characteristic asymmetry and a spike above zero are clearly visible, echoing the same distributional pattern identified in the 1997 study.\n\n\n\nFigure3\n\n\nHowever, the interpretation of these analyses should not be taken at face value. Some researchers argue that the spike in small profits may not stem from intentional earnings manipulation, but rather reflect economic cycles or natural firm behavior, where managers work harder to avoid losses (Makarem et al., 2023). Holland (2004) also notes that rounding in financial reports could partly explain the observed pattern.\nThese limitations highlight the complexity of the issue and suggest important future research ideas, such as examining how different regulatory environments or economic conditions affect the frequency and methods of earnings management.\nStill, the enduring relevance of Burgstahler and Dichev’s study lies in the conversation it sparked. It reminds us that even legal accounting numbers can tell distorted stories, as behind the spreadsheets lie strategic choices influenced by pressures and incentives. Understanding this doesn’t just help us read financial statements more critically, it invites us to question how transparency is defined and where boundaries of acceptable accounting behavior end.\nReferences:\nBurgstahler, D. and Dichev, I.

    "title": "Certified confusion - greenwashing in EU’s sustainability auditing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Distinguishing the good guys from the bad ones is getting more difficult by the day. It seems as if green has become everyone’s favourite color: at least if you look at packaging, advertisements, websites, or any other signal from companies to stakeholders. Brands are giving out reassuring promises of sustainability and environmental friendliness, nicely printed in a forest green font. Whether it be Fair Trade, FSC, ASC, ISO-14001, EU Ecolabel or Rainforest Alliance’s cute little frog, the more of these shiny stickers you have to hide under, the better. How do you collect them? Not as relevant. Take H&M’s “Conscious Collection,” for example - a line marketed as sustainable, yet criticized for still relying on fast-fashion overproduction (BBC, 2021). Or Nestlé’s pledge to make 100% of its packaging recyclable by 2025, while remaining one of the world’s top plastic polluters (Break Free From Plastic, 2022). Even oil giants like BP and Shell have rebranded with leafy logos and vague net-zero commitments, despite continuing to expand fossil fuel extraction (The Guardian, 2023). It almost feels like the more a company shouts about sustainability, the harder one should squint at the fine print. The problem isn’t just misinformation (unintentional false claims) but disinformation - strategic deception dressed as progress. And with every new certification or green buzzword, the line between real change and misleading PR gets blurrier.\nWhile the use of environmental certificates, such as the ISO-14001 and EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) in the EU, is getting more popular by the day (see Figure 1), has their significance suffered inflation? Were they ever of any value at all? Testa et al. (2015) juggle these questions in their study on the internalization of environmental practices and stakeholder pressure. The article examines whether stakeholder pressures encourage companies to genuinely adopt environmental practices or just engage in “greenwashing”, i.e. superficially adopting practices for appearances without real impact. The authors ran a survey and got 232 responses from EMAS-registered organizations. The survey asked managers to e.g. rate the importance of each stakeholder on the organization’s decision to adopt environmental actions. Their main interest is in the external and internal factors affecting how truly the EMAS requirements are actually internalized in an organization. External factors consist of a list of stakeholders, including banks, customers, suppliers, shareholders etc. The internal ones include price and quality, meaning whether organizations use cost savings or quality management as the key strategy to improve competitiveness.\nThe findings of Testa et al. (2015) reveal that the pressure of stakeholders depends crucially on which stakeholders are being looked at. The observed differences are quite surprising. Shareholders, suppliers, and financial institutions push for meaningful environmental improvements, while customers and industrial associations may inadvertently encourage greenwashing by prioritizing certification over actual performance. Furthermore, companies with a strong focus on product quality are more likely to internalize environmental practices, whereas ones with cost-saving strategies show no significant effect. This is more in line with what one might expect: quality-driven firms see environmental practices as complementary to their business goals, whereas cost-saving ones may view them as a trade-off.\nThe question of what constitutes “improved environmental performance” and how it is measured remains a key challenge in sustainability research. Some studies, like Melnyk et al. (2003), use concrete metrics such as reduced waste or emissions and find a positive impact, while others, like Barla (2007), find no clear link between EMS adoption and actual environmental gains. This inconsistency could mean that performance improvements depend on how deeply environmental practices are internalized - beyond mere certification. So Testa et al. (2015) are asking exactly the right questions; as they note, “the conflicting findings of the literature […] could be related to the uncertain internalization [of EMSs]”. They also talk about symbolic corporate environmentalism, which further complicates this issue. The term refers to a sneaky form of greenwashing that is subtle and systemic - less visible than outright misinformation but equally problematic. Bowen and Aragon-Correa (2014) describe it as a disconnect between policy and practice, where firms adopt EMSs for legitimacy without operational change.\nIt would have been valuable for the study to explore how stakeholder pressures vary across industries - for example, whether manufacturing firms face different pressures from customers than the food industry. And while we’re at it, potential differences in stakeholder pressures between firms with cost-saving versus quality-focused strategies could also be interesting to see. Such an analysis could reveal whether the differences in who internalizes systematically and who symbolically is connected to the industry. Without this breakdown, the study’s findings remain broad, missing opportunities to pinpoint where stakeholder pressures actually translate into real environmental action - and where they don’t.\nSo, does the Testa et al. (2015) provide any useful evidence? This study investigates two key questions: 1. which external (stakeholder pressures) and internal (corporate strategy) factors influence the real adoption of EMAS environmental practices, and 2. whether the internalization of EMAS requirements - measured through planning, operational activities, training, and monitoring - truly reflects meaningful environmental commitment or just superficial compliance. However, surveys are always surveys. The unfortunate caveat of this method is that it only answers the research question if we believe that respondents were objective robots. There is an existing and rather likely possibility that the responses are influenced by willingness to maintain a positive firm image. This would lead to the coefficients being consistently too high. Another issue with the data is that survey-based perceptions of stakeholder influence might not align with reality. While a stakeholder is thought to have a lot of influence on organizational behavior, their actual power over firms’ environmental actions remains unclear. To answer this question, further studies should be conducted. With quantitative data on environmental outcomes of firms, the study would be even more convincing - but gathering this data is easier said than done."

    "title": "People Fall for Fake News Because They Fail to Think How Reflecting Beats Partisan Clickbait",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Picture 1. Headline Example\n\n\nIs your first instinct after reading this headline to share—or to question? You might think “No way, that can’t be real.” But why? Is it because you support Donald Trump, or because the story simply feels far-fetched? That gut reaction tells something important about how we process news.\nThat eye-catching headline was one of the democrat-aligned fake headlines used by Pennycook and Rand. In their paper “Lazy, not biased: Susceptibility to partisan fake news is better explained by lack of reasoning than by motivated reasoning,” they argue that people fall for fake news not because they are politically biased, but because they fail to engage in analytical thinking.\n\n\nAfter the 2016 U.S. election, the top 20 fake-news stories on Facebook saw more engagement than the top 20 real ones (Silverman et al., 2016). Two big theories raced to explain why:\n\nMotivated reasoning suggests that when we think hard, we actually twist facts to fit our political perspective — accepting claims confirming our beliefs and dismissing inconvenient truths. For example, studies show this approach works for the topics like climate change (Kahan et al., 2012) or gun control (Kahan et al., 2017).\nClassical dual-process theory says analytic thinking simply helps us spot nonsense, regardless of ideology. Typical examples include rejecting paranormal claims (Pennycook et al., 2012) or conspiracy theories (Swami et al., 2014).\n\nSo, does analytical thinking help or hurt?\n\n\n\nPennycook and Rand measured analytic thinking with the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), featuring puzzles such as:\nA bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much is the ball? (Frederick, 2005)\nIf you reflexively answer 10 cents (which is wrong, because if the ball cost 10 cents, the bat would have to cost $1.10 and they would total $1.20), you’re relying on intuition. If you pause and reflect, you arrive at the correct 5 cents. High CRT scores signal a willingness to override gut instincts and think analytically. The same applies when judging news.\n\n\n\nTo see whether “thinking harder” helps or hurts, Pennycook and Rand recruited large samples - 800 participants in the first study and 2 644 in the replication - of Clinton and Trump supporters. They showed each person a Facebook-style feed of real and fake headlines split into democrat-friendly, republican-friendly, and neutral categories. Participants first judged how accurate each headline felt and whether they would share it, and then took the short CRT.\n\n\n\n1. High-CRT readers were consistently better judges—no matter whose side the headline favored.\nWhether a headline praised Clinton or Trump made no difference: high-CRT readers doubted fakes and trusted reals (Fig. 1). The same reflective habit also made them less willing to pass fakes along on social media.\n2. People judged headlines that matched their politics a bit more accurately\nThat feels like motivated reasoning—but they were also stricter with same-side fakes. There is simply more background knowledge about familiar topics. Simply saying, democrats spotted democrat-friendly fakes better than cross-party ones, while Trump supporters showed little or only modest advantage for their own-side fakes.\n3. Overall, Clinton supporters out-performed Trump supporters at telling real from fake.\nInterestingly, participants preferring Clinton over Trump showed generally stronger truth-discernment than Trump supporters. However, this ideological difference was significantly smaller than the difference created by varying levels of analytical reasoning.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Mean perceived accuracy of (a) fake and (b) real news headlines as a function of political ideology (support for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump), political valence of headline (Democrat-consistent or Republican-consistent), and Cognitive Reflection Test performance (bottom quartile = “intuitive”; top quartile = “deliberative”), based on the data of Study 2. Clinton support: N (intuitive) = 457; N (deliberative) = 577. Trump support: N (intuitive) = 422; N (deliberative) = 386. Error bars represent 95% CIs.\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous study by Pennycook et al. (2018) confirmed that viral fake news are usually largely implausible. To check if plausibility is actually a stimulus for analytic thinkers, in Study 3 authors ranked headlines from “sounds crazy” to “sounds reasonable”. In short, the wilder the headline, the more reflection helps, regardless of political flavor —just what the classical reasoning account predicts.\nTry it yourself:\n“Because Of The Lack Of Men, Iceland Gives $5 000 Per Month To Immigrants Who Marry Icelandic Women!” vs. “Yellowstone Evacuated: Experts Claim ‘Super Volcano’ Could Erupt Within Weeks”.\nWhich one seems more believable? Both are false, but I would assume readers may laugh at the first and pause at the second—and that pause is exactly what the CRT picks up. The paper gives average plausibility scores but does not publish a full “craziest-to-most-believable” ranking, so this Iceland-versus-Yellowstone contrast is illustrative rather than official.\nThe results of analyses match the classical model - reflection filters out nonsense, it doesn’t reinforce bias. But why didn’t motivated reasoning show up here? Previous work showing that reflection deepens political divides often focused on complex topics—e.g., climate science or gun statistics (Kahan et al., 2012; Kahan et al., 2017) —where even the most motivated reader sometimes lacks the background to evaluate claims. Fake-news headlines, by contrast, are typically loud and implausible by design. And if we bother to think, we can actually realize something is off (“Why would Iceland pay immigrants to marry women?”).\n\n\n\nPennycook and Rand’s work suggests that nurturing critical thinking may be a good defense against misinformation. Some practical implementations following from the paper may be as follows:\n\nThink-twice prompts. A quick “Are you sure?” before the Share button can trigger reflection.\nMicro-training. Five-minute CRT-style quizzes teach the pause habit.\nPlausibility flags. Down-ranking headlines that scream “too good to be true” gives users room to think.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame the question differently. Swap “Is this accurate?” for “Do you believe this?”—the authors expect political bias might re-appear.\nAdd identity cues (“Friends shared this”) or a quick warning (“Some stories are false”)—do they blunt or boost reflection?\nTest outside the lab. Running the study in live social-media feeds or in other political systems will show if the “lazy, not biased” pattern remains.\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to eye-popping political headlines, the problem isn’t people’s partisan identity—it’s the mental autopilot that lets a sensational claim sail past unexamined. Lazy, not biased. So, when we pause to think, political color of a headline matters far less than plausibility—and most fakes crumble.\n\n\n\nFrederick, S. (2005).

The paper gives average plausibility scores but does not publish a full “craziest-to-most-believable” ranking, so this Iceland-versus-Yellowstone contrast is illustrative rather than official.\nThe results of analyses match the classical model - reflection filters out nonsense, it doesn’t reinforce bias. But why didn’t motivated reasoning show up here? Previous work showing that reflection deepens political divides often focused on complex topics—e.g., climate science or gun statistics (Kahan et al., 2012; Kahan et al., 2017) —where even the most motivated reader sometimes lacks the background to evaluate claims. Fake-news headlines, by contrast, are typically loud and implausible by design. And if we bother to think, we can actually realize something is off (“Why would Iceland pay immigrants to marry women?”)."

    "title": "Greenwashing as Financial Disinformation: Implications for Shareholders and Firm Value",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Everyone has been there: you see a product labeled “climate-neutral” or “eco-friendly”, and you wonder: is that label just a marketing campaign or actually true? Could the company behind it actually contribute to environmental harm and get away with it? And if people find out, does anything actually happen?\nThis post translates those questions into the language of financial markets. Using evidence from a recent study by Xu et al. (2025), we’ll explore how greenwashing functions as financial disinformation, what happens when companies are exposed, and why this distortion of corporate transparency matters for shareholders and firm value. To give a sense of how damaging greenwashing can be: after the Dieselgate scandal broke, Volkswagen lost over $17 billion in market value in just one week — more than Commerzbank’s entire market value at that time (= $12.5 billion around this time in October 2015, according to companiesmarketcap).\n\n\nGreenwashing is commonly defined as misleading publicity or propaganda used by companies to project an environmentally responsible image, often unfounded or deliberately deceptive (OED). This can involve selective disclosure, such as highlighting green initiatives while hiding harmful ones, or decoupling, whereby public sustainability claims do not match actual business practices. Whether intentional or not, both tactics mislead investors and the public by distorting the true state of a company’s environmental performance.\nWhat’s important to note is that greenwashing is not just a marketing tactic; it can be a form of financial disinformation. According to the American Psychological Association, disinformation is false information shared deliberately to mislead (unlike misinformation, which is unintentionally shared false information). This makes greenwashing particularly dangerous, as investors with the honourable goal of supporting a sustainable future may be misled by companies without realising.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, Xu et al. examine greenwashing in the context of signalling theory, which addresses information asymmetry. Since investors cannot observe a firm’s true sustainability practices, they rely on signals such as sustainability disclosures and reports. If a firm’s signals are later revealed to be false, investors must re-evaluate the firm’s trustworthiness and value.\nThe breakdown of the transparency process is illustrated in the figure below. This is based on the sender/receiver theory in the Accounting for Transparency framework proposed by Bischof et al. (2024), which shows how transparency emerges from communication between firms (senders) and stakeholders (receivers) and is based on three attributes: disclosure, accuracy and clarity.\n Adapted from Fig. 1 in Bischof et al. (2024, p. 577). The original diagram (black and grey elements) was modified to illustrate how greenwashing disturbs transparency. Green elements represent components that remain intact, while red elements show where greenwashing introduces distortion.\n\nIf all of this theory is true and greenwashing distorts signals and transparency, does this also affect real-world financial outcomes? And if so, how do investors reward firms for appearing green and do they punish them when the truth comes out?\n\n\n\n\nTo answer these questions, Xu et al. (2025) conducted a global event-study, analyzing 121 greenwashing news events from the 2015 Paris Agreement to 2021 involving 68 publicly listed firms. They tracked abnormal stock returns in the days around greenwashing news disclosure to measure market reaction.\n\n\nThey calculated abnormal returns, which are the differences between a company’s actual stock return and the expected return based on market conditions. By summing these over a short window around each news event, the study produced Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs), a snapshot of the total market reaction. This approach allows to isolate the impact of greenwashing news from other market influences on firm value.\nTo gain a more comprehensive view, the authors ran cross-sectional regressions to test whether the reaction of the stock price differed according to firm characteristics like:\n\nthe concreteness of greenwashing (e.g. clear evidence vs. vague claims)\ngeographic region\nindustry type\nESG performance\n\n\n\n\nSo how does the market respond? In a word: negatively. The authors found when greenwashing news broke, stock prices declined. The study uncovered several factors that influenced these reactions.\n\nThe market reacted far more harshly to concrete evidence, such as clear misuse of green bond proceeds, than to vague or speculative claims.\nThe industry played a role: manufacturing firms experienced steeper declines than service firms, likely due to their more direct environmental impact.\nRegional differences mattered. Companies in the Asia-Pacific region faced particularly severe reactions, possibly due to weaker regulatory environments that made violations seem more disappointing.\nFinally, and perhaps most surprisingly, firms with high ESG scores (= more sustainable firms) suffered the most. The higher the environmental expectations, the greater the sense of betrayal and the sharper was the sell-off when those expectations were not met.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings from Xu et al. deliver a clear warning: greenwashing carries real financial consequences. For firms, the risk isn’t just reputational; it’s economic. Even a strong ESG Performance won’t shield a company from sharp market penalties once it makes false claims and those are exposed as misleading. Trust, once lost, is hard and expensive to regain.\nFor investors, the study reinforces the need for skepticism. ESG scores may serve as useful signals, but they’re not infallible. What matters is how companies behave under scrutiny, not just how they market themselves. The appearance of sustainability must be backed by substance.\nMore broadly, the research highlights that transparency only works when corporate communication is accurate and clear. These are not optional best practices, but rather the very foundation of investor trust. Once that trust is broken, even highly rated firms can see their valuations decrease.\nThe bottom line: greenwashing is more than image management. It disrupts transparency in financial markets and markets react accordingly, punishing misleading firms.\n\n\n\nAmerican Psychological Association. (n.d.). Misinformation and disinformation.

    "title": "Emotion vs. Truth - Why We Fall for Fake News",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotion vs. Truth - Why We Fall for Fake News\nHave you ever shared a shocking news story before checking whether it was true? If so, you are not alone. In our fast-paced digital world, it is becoming easier than ever to write and publish news articles and opinions, as well as to share them. A single post can nowadays reach millions of people around the world in a matter of hours. But how can we distinguish between a factual article and fake news? And what role do our emotions play in this process?\nIn recent years much research has focused on how analytical thinking, or its absence, affects susceptibility to false information. A study by Martel et al. (2020) builds on this research and adds an important new dimension to it: What happens when we let our emotions, rather than reason, guide our judgment of truth? Their findings provide valuable insights, showing that emotion is not just a background influence. It actively shapes whether we believe a headline is true, especially when that headline is false.\n\nThe researchers explored this question through a two-study design. In the first design, a correlational design, they asked over 400 participants to rate their current emotional state. Afterwards, participants were shown a mix of real and fake political headlines and asked to evaluate their perceived accuracy. In the second design, a much larger experimental study, they used nearly 4000 participants. The participants were split into 3 groups before they again rated political headlines for their truthfulness. One group was instructed to rely on their emotions, another to rely on reason, and the third received no instructions and served as a control group. The experimental design is depicted in Figure 1. This setup did not only allow the researchers to explore whether emotion correlates with suspected truthfulness, but also whether encouraging a certain mindset can influence the way people judge accuracy.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nFigure 2 & 3 illustrate the frequencies of the perceived accuracy ratings participants gave to fake and real headlines. Both figures include accuracy ratings in the form of a Likert scale going from 1 (not accurate at all) to 6 (extremely accurate). Figure 2 shows that people who reported feeling more emotional were significantly more likely to believe fake news headlines. This was true regardless of whether the emotions were positive or negative. Interestingly, emotions which are associated with careful thinking, such as being “interested”, “determined” and “attentive”, did not increase belief in misinformation. As shown in Figure 3, this effect was specific to fake news and had no influence on belief in real headlines. All three conditions had similar accuracy ratings for the news stories. This shows that emotions don’t generally impair judgment about truth, but they do make us more susceptible to misinformation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 and 3\n\n\nWhen participants were instructed to base their judgment on either emotion or reason, the results support the earlier findings. Participants who were asked to base their judgment on emotions were more likely to believe fake headlines more than the participants who were told to rely on reason. This shows that emotions are not a neutral factor in our decision process, but rather that they actively influence our beliefs.\nThese findings fit well within the broader context of psychology and behavioral economics. Daniel Kahneman describes in his book “Thinking, fast and slow” (2011) a cognitive concept about two different ways the brain can form its judgment:\n\nSystem 1: Fast, automatic, emotional and unconscious\nSystem 2: Slow, effortful, logical and conscious\n\nMartel et al.’s results align closely with this framework. When people rely on System 1 thinking, they form beliefs quickly and emotionally, often without conscious thought, leading people to make their judgment before reflecting on the information. This ties back to our opening question: Have you ever shared shocking news before checking if it was true? The consequence of this system is that it can lead to cognitive biases as well as misjudgments. In contrast, when people engage in System 2 thinking, they slow down and evaluate information more critically. As Martel et al. (2020) found, participants who relied on reason, rather than emotion, made more accurate judgment distinguishing between true and false headlines.\nThe study highlights the importance of relying on reason rather than emotion when judging whether information is accurate. Especially in today’s media environment, where platforms are designed for engagement, rather than accuracy. This is problematic, since false content spreads faster and gets more attention than the truth. The real-world implications of this are serious. Misinformation not only shapes political beliefs, but also consumer behavior, health decisions and financial markets. Kogan et al. (2023) found that false financial news led to an increase in retail trading and prices, followed by a sharp decline when the truth emerged. Overvalued firms then saw a sharp drop in their stock prices. This shows the real financial risk of falling for misinformation.\nWhile this study by Martel et al. deepens our understanding of how emotions influence our perception of truth, it also raises several new questions. For instance, future research could examine how emotional nudges affect truth judgment. This means rather than actively influencing the basis of the decision-making, how would passive priming of certain emotions affect truth judgement? Additionally, this study focuses on the differences between emotion and reason. But isn’t there a middle ground? What happens when people engage in both emotion and reason simultaneously? Finally, since all the headlines used in the study were political, it remains to be seen whether these effects hold in other scenarios as well. These could include health misinformation, lifestyle and entertainment news, or financial reporting.\nIn a world of endless scrolling and quick sharing of information emotional reactions are fast, but not always wise. Martel et al. (2020) show that the way we think affects what we believe. While emotions play a powerful role in decision-making, they may mislead us when we try to judge the truthfulness of information. Pausing to think and engaging in our rational mind might just be the best way to not fall for misinformation.\n\n\nBibliography:\nMartel, C., Pennycook, G., & Rand, D. G. (2020).

    "title": "When Rumors Move Billions: What Fake News Does to Stock Prices",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What happens when a lie spreads faster than the truth and the stock market listens?\nImagine scrolling through Twitter and seeing the following post: “Apple under SEC investigation for accounting fraud.” The tweet spreads fast. Traders react. Apple’s stock drops, at least for a moment, before the rumor is debunked and the price recovers.\nBut what if fake news does more than cause a quick scare? What if it leaves a lasting mark on financial markets?\nThat’s exactly what a recent paper by Arcuri, Gandolfi, and Russo (2023) set out to explore: how lies and viral headlines can influence market behavior, particularly through investor reactions in the United States and the European Union.\n\n\nWe’re used to thinking of fake news as a political issue: typically something that misleads voters, rather than investors. But in a hyper-connected world where information spreads faster than it can be verified, financial markets aren’t immune to misinformation.\nThis made me wonder: just how much damage can a false headline do to a stock price?\nTo investigate, Arcuri, Gandolfi, and Russo (2023) analyzed 149 instances of fake news events between 2007 and 2019. These weren’t just vague rumors or Twitter gossip; each one was a verifiably false story involving publicly listed companies in the US and the EU.\n\n\n\nTo determine how markets responded, the authors employed an event study. This method compared actual stock returns around the time of the fake news event with what would normally be expected, helping to isolate the specific impact of the false story. They also ran OLS regression analysis to examine which factors influenced the size of the market reaction.\nBut they didn’t stop there. The paper also digs into deeper questions that I found particularly relevant:\n\nAre some markets more sensitive than others?\n\nDo prices bounce back quickly, or does the damage linger?\n\nAre smaller firms more vulnerable than larger ones?\n\nAnd does the type of fake news matter?\n\nThe result is one of the most detailed studies I’ve seen on how disinformation, not from companies themselves but from external sources, affects real-time investor behavior.\n\n\n\nFake news does move markets. In some cases, the effect is temporary. In others, it sticks longer than you’d expect. Here’s what stood out to me.\nOne of the clearest findings was the short-term market reaction. Immediately after a fake news event, stock prices often dropped significantly, sometimes by nearly 2% when the story was negative. That may not sound catastrophic, but it’s far from trivial, especially for investors holding the affected stocks. The speed of the reaction suggests that markets respond almost immediately, before the accuracy of the information can be verified.\nHere’s a visual summary of this drop-and-recovery pattern:\n\n\n\nFigure: Average abnormal returns\n\n\nThere were hints that European markets may have reacted more sharply than U.S. markets in some instances. Still, the authors were cautious in concluding, given the smaller EU sample size and the fact that most statistically significant effects were found in the U.S. data.\nStill, the possibility was intriguing — could differences in investor behavior, media ecosystems, or institutional trust be driving regional variation?\nIn most cases, prices began to recover within a couple of days, suggesting that the market eventually corrects itself. But that recovery wasn’t always immediate. In some cases, especially involving negative fake news, the effects persisted for up to five trading days. That delay matters because even a short-lived mispricing can cause significant volatility and losses, especially for retail investors or algorithmic traders caught off guard.\nSmaller firms turned out to be especially vulnerable. This isn’t surprising, considering that when a company has less public visibility or fewer analyst reports, investors have fewer alternative sources to rely on. So, if a false story spreads, there’s less competing information to correct it.\nFinally, the tone and credibility of the fake news mattered. Stories published on professional-looking websites or styled like press releases triggered stronger price movements than obvious hoaxes. Negative stories also had a much greater impact than neutral or positive ones.\nTogether, these findings give weight to the paper’s main message: fake news — especially when negative and credible — can cause measurable price distortions, particularly for more vulnerable firms.\n\n\n\nI think this research makes one thing clear: fake news isn’t just noise. It creates measurable ripples in financial markets, and sometimes, it results in real losses.\n\nMarket efficiency isn’t bulletproof\nAccording to finance theory, prices should only change when new, relevant information becomes available. But fake news has no informational value.\nTo me, the fact that it moves prices at all suggests that markets are more fragile than we often assume.\nFirms with lower visibility are at risk\nSmaller companies saw bigger impacts: smaller firms can’t correct misinformation as quickly or as visibly. That has implications for how they manage communication and investor relations.\nSpeed wins over truth\nMarkets absorb headlines quickly, but unwind the damage slowly, often before a story can even be fact-checked.\nRegulators may be overlooking a blind spot\nFinancial regulation typically focuses on insiders or firms misleading the public.

    "text": "We’re used to thinking of fake news as a political issue: typically something that misleads voters, rather than investors. But in a hyper-connected world where information spreads faster than it can be verified, financial markets aren’t immune to misinformation.\nThis made me wonder: just how much damage can a false headline do to a stock price?\nTo investigate, Arcuri, Gandolfi, and Russo (2023) analyzed 149 instances of fake news events between 2007 and 2019. These weren’t just vague rumors or Twitter gossip; each one was a verifiably false story involving publicly listed companies in the US and the EU."

This method compared actual stock returns around the time of the fake news event with what would normally be expected, helping to isolate the specific impact of the false story. They also ran OLS regression analysis to examine which factors influenced the size of the market reaction.\nBut they didn’t stop there. The paper also digs into deeper questions that I found particularly relevant:\n\nAre some markets more sensitive than others?\n\nDo prices bounce back quickly, or does the damage linger?\n\nAre smaller firms more vulnerable than larger ones?\n\nAnd does the type of fake news matter?\n\nThe result is one of the most detailed studies I’ve seen on how disinformation, not from companies themselves but from external sources, affects real-time investor behavior."

    "text": "Fake news does move markets. In some cases, the effect is temporary. In others, it sticks longer than you’d expect. Here’s what stood out to me.\nOne of the clearest findings was the short-term market reaction. Immediately after a fake news event, stock prices often dropped significantly, sometimes by nearly 2% when the story was negative. That may not sound catastrophic, but it’s far from trivial, especially for investors holding the affected stocks. The speed of the reaction suggests that markets respond almost immediately, before the accuracy of the information can be verified.\nHere’s a visual summary of this drop-and-recovery pattern:\n\n\n\nFigure: Average abnormal returns\n\n\nThere were hints that European markets may have reacted more sharply than U.S. markets in some instances. Still, the authors were cautious in concluding, given the smaller EU sample size and the fact that most statistically significant effects were found in the U.S. data.\nStill, the possibility was intriguing — could differences in investor behavior, media ecosystems, or institutional trust be driving regional variation?\nIn most cases, prices began to recover within a couple of days, suggesting that the market eventually corrects itself. But that recovery wasn’t always immediate. In some cases, especially involving negative fake news, the effects persisted for up to five trading days. That delay matters because even a short-lived mispricing can cause significant volatility and losses, especially for retail investors or algorithmic traders caught off guard.\nSmaller firms turned out to be especially vulnerable. This isn’t surprising, considering that when a company has less public visibility or fewer analyst reports, investors have fewer alternative sources to rely on. So, if a false story spreads, there’s less competing information to correct it.\nFinally, the tone and credibility of the fake news mattered. Stories published on professional-looking websites or styled like press releases triggered stronger price movements than obvious hoaxes. Negative stories also had a much greater impact than neutral or positive ones.\nTogether, these findings give weight to the paper’s main message: fake news — especially when negative and credible — can cause measurable price distortions, particularly for more vulnerable firms."

But fake news has no informational value.\nTo me, the fact that it moves prices at all suggests that markets are more fragile than we often assume.\nFirms with lower visibility are at risk\nSmaller companies saw bigger impacts: smaller firms can’t correct misinformation as quickly or as visibly.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In financial markets, prices are meant to incorporate information, allowing markets to function efficiently. But sometimes, traders deliberately manipulate prices to profit at the expense of others. In their study “Stock Manipulation and Its Effects: Pump and Dump versus Stabilization”, Yu Chuan Huang and Yao Jen Cheng (2015) examine how these tactics play out in Taiwan’s stock markets. Drawing on 118 prosecuted manipulation cases between 1991 and 2010, they explore what happens to prices, volatility, and investor behaviour during and after manipulation. While previous research had already shown that manipulation was possible, Huang and Cheng push further by comparing two distinct strategies: aggressive Pump-and-Dump operations and quieter Stabilization attempts. Their study is among the first to use a large hand-collected sample to examine real-world manipulation in an emerging market, one where regulation is looser and retail investors dominate. What they find has clear implications for market oversight and investor protection."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2022, Swedish oat milk brand Oatly claimed that switching from dairy to oat milk was “the single biggest lifestyle change” for reducing environmental impact. But as the UK Advertising Standards Authority later revealed, the assertion relied on the opinion of a single climate expert and was ultimately deemed misleading (The Guardian, 2022). Two years later, Virgin Atlantic promoted its “100 percent sustainable aviation fuel”—a claim that vastly overstated the reality that their fuel produced only slightly fewer emissions than conventional jet fuel (Time, 2024). FIJI Water’s slogan, “Bottled at the source, untouched by man,” similarly obscured troubling practices: extensive diesel use, 5,500-mile shipping, and the company’s refusal to pay local water taxes—even as 12 percent of Fijians lacked access to clean drinking water (New University, 2021).\nThese cases share a common thread: they were all deemed misleading by regulators and widely condemned in the media as greenwashing. Greenwashing occurs when companies combine poor environmental performance with positive communication about it (Delmas & Burbano, 2011). Today, it permeates nearly every sector—from food and cosmetics to fashion, energy, transportation, and finance.\nThis wave of high-profile cases points to a bigger trend. As regulators act against false claims, public awareness of greenwashing has grown rapidly. Google Trends data show interest in the term has surged over the past 15 years (see Figure 1). Academic interest has followed suit: only 27 percent of all “greenwashing” publications indexed on Google Scholar appeared before 2010; since then, the number has more than tripled.\n\n\n\nInterest in “greenwashing” over time (Source: Google Trends, 2025)\n\n\nOne striking case is the South Korean beauty brand Innisfree. In 2021, it marketed its products in “paper bottles,” only for consumers to discover plastic bottles hidden beneath cardboard sleeves. (see Figure 2).\n.\nThe backlash was swift and fierce, turning the campaign into a textbook example of consumer deception.\nTo understand how people respond to such betrayals, Yannopoulou et al. (2024) applied Expectancy Disconfirmation Theory (EDT), which suggests consumer satisfaction depends on whether brand promises match reality. Their qualitative study analyzed 735 comments from 632 unique users across Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, using thematic analysis to map patterns in consumer reactions. This approach revealed three distinct response types, illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nConceptual framework of consumer responses to greenwashing (Source: own illustration)\n\n\nSome consumers, dubbed “Result-oriented Advocates,” focused entirely on outcomes. When they realized the claims were false, they reacted with anger and called for boycotts, often abandoning the brand altogether. Their comments frequently featured capital letters, expletives, and negative emojis:\n\n“THEY SHOULD BE SUED!!!!😡😡”\n“Are you f*****g kidding meeeeee!!!!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯”\n“This is infuriating and manipulative. Companies are clearly taking advantage of our good conscience🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️”\n“Never buying anything from this company”\n\nOthers, “Process-oriented Advocates,” took a more forgiving stance. They valued the company’s efforts and were willing to overlook missteps if they believed the intentions were genuine. A typical comment reflected this view:\n\n“Wouldnt call it greenwashing. How you are supposed to hold the cosmestics with paper packaging? Also if you already read their notes, you’d know that by doing this they reduce around 50 percent of plastic consumption and boost recycling of the plastic packaging as well with this line. Firms are making changes within their means to become more sustainable, please dont disregard it with a simple ‘greenwashing’ hat.”\n\nA third group, “Holistic Assessors,” adopted a nuanced view, weighing both results and processes. Their reactions were often ambivalent but no less critical:\n\n“If they’re gonna separate plastic from paper, they should also separate everything else. Or, they should just make an actually eco-friendly bottle by removing the paper entirely or making the whole thing out of paper, instead of lying to everyone.”\n\nThe Innisfree case shows how greenwashing creates deep fault lines in consumer trust. While earlier studies show exaggerated eco-claims erode brand equity (Nyilasy et al., 2014; Seele & Gatti, 2017), Yannopoulou et al. (2024) go further by highlighting how consumers’ moral frameworks shape their responses. Misaligned environmental messaging breeds skepticism (Nadaňyiová et al., 2020), while authentic, transparent communication fosters loyalty—even amid failures (Guo et al., 2017).\nFor brands, the message is clear: authenticity and transparency are no longer optional. Superficial eco-claims may generate short-term buzz but risk long-term reputational and financial damage, especially as social media amplifies negative word-of-mouth. To avoid becoming the next viral scandal, firms must embed sustainability into their core operations and engage in honest crisis communication when missteps occur.\nFor researchers, future studies could examine cultural and generational differences in responses to greenwashing, as well as how brands can rebuild trust post-crisis.\nUltimately, greenwashing reflects a deeper tension: the market’s appetite for sustainability often outpaces its willingness to pursue systemic change. Brands that survive this scrutiny will be those whose sustainability claims are backed by measurable action—not just paper wrapped around plastic.\n\nDelmas, M., & Burbano, V. (2011).

    "text": "Though cinema frames the Mafia in tailored suits, vintage Cadillacs, and solemn church parades, the reality in Palermo is cruel. The same men who carry statues at religious feasts also carry glue guns at night. A lot of losses are incurred because merchants don’t pay protection money.That protection money—called pizzo—became Sicily’s unofficial tax on trade.\nPaying protection money is not something everyone is willing to do just to survive. In 2004 a student group, Addiopizzo (“Good‑bye, Protection Money”), chose a different weapon: data. By turning whispers into audited numbers, and releasing those numbers in timed waves, they rewired what Sicilians believed, where they shopped, and how much the Mafia earned. Addiopizzo’s action showed a great impact that transparency could make.\n\n\n\nOrganizational transparency means disclosing key internal data—such as finances, membership, or decisions—to external stakeholders and civil society. (Madsen, 2009; Vaccaro & Patino Echeverri, 2010)\n\nAddiopizzo made that transparency dynamic.\n\n\n\nThe Mafia maintains control not only through violence, but through a three-layer system of coercion, confusion, and culture:\n Fig 1. Reasons for protection money\n\nTargeted Retaliation (Fear): Businesses that refuse to pay are sometimes attacked and damaged. This can spread the message that others will suffer the same, although attacks are rare (Scaglione & Punzo, 2025).\nInformation Asymmetry (Uncertainty): Mafia groups infiltrate the police and officials. Victims believe they can’t rely on the state for help. Merchants suppose everyone is complying.\nCultural Normalization (Legitimacy): Mafia members appear at religious celebrations. Even funerals are a place they can be found. They do not appear as criminals. They appear as so-called “protectors”. This makes extortion seem acceptable, even normal.\n\n\n\n\n–Addiopizzo makes hidden information visible.\n\nInformation disclosure is meant to address the four issues: limited moral imagination, organizational legitimacy, resistance to change and threat of Mafia attacks. (Vaccaro, 2012)\n\n\n\n1. Pizzo-free map: reducing the fearness\nOne of Addiopizzo’s most effective tools was also its simplest: a publicly available list of businesses that had refused to pay protection money. Updated regularly and organised by name, location and industry, the list did more than just inform; it changed public expectations.\n Fig 2. Pizzo-free mechants map from Addiopizzo.org (https://addiopizzo.org/en/what-we-do/critical-consumption/)\nFor merchants, it broke the silence. Direct, verifiable evidence that refusal was possible, even common, was provided in the list. It challenged “everyone pays”, the dominant belief, which is a key barrier that Vaccaro (2012) identifies as a “limited moral imagination”.\nFor consumers, the supply chain was rewired. Shoppers could actively support certified businesses, turning everyday purchases into anti-Mafia statements. This behavioral loop turned the market into a tool of resistance.\nAs more firms joined, the economic space available for extortion decreased. The effect was measurable.\n2. Anti-Racket Stickers: Making resistance seen\nAddiopizzo did more than just publish lists. They weaved anti-extortion messages into daily economic life. Its stickers, bearing the simple, black-and-white logo Pizzo-Free, appeared on shop windows, product packaging and sales receipts.\n\nFig 3. Addiopizzo Sticker from Addiopizzo.org (https://addiopizzo.org/en/what-we-do/critical-consumption/)\nEach sticker performed three functions:\n\nSpatial Insurgency Tools: Converting private storefronts into public declarations of resistance, remapping commercial space as anti-Mafia territory.\nViolence Exposure Triggers: Vandalism by Mafia actors turned implicit threats into documented evidence, forcing invisible coercion into legal/political view.\nReal-Time Trust Networks: Sustained sticker visibility created a live “ethical cartography,” enabling consumers to identify safe businesses at a glance.\n\n Fig 4. How stickers work\nFrom 2005 to 2019, Addiopizzo’s members rose from 1,214 entrepreneurs and 13,376 consumers to include large corporations.(see Figure 4, Lipari & Andrighetto, 2020).\n Fig 5. Subscription to Addiopizzo from 2005 until 2019. Source of data comes directly from Addiopizzo dataset. Elaboration of the authors.(Lipari & Andrighetto, 2020)\nIn 2007, the association counted 210 traders and entrepreneurs as members and over 9,000 consumers committed to buying only at shops belonging to the “pizzo-free” list.(Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiopizzo)\nIn practice, it became a low-cost, high-impact governance mechanism driven by disclosure rather than force.\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows its disclosure project breaks down the mafia’s control over the economy. They publicise both the Mafia’s message and their own, to avoid being attacked by the Mafia. The most significant innovation is the transition of the two types of information into visual formats, turning everyday consumption into a means of collective resistance:\nTable 1: Typologies of disclosed information and related issues to be fixed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation typology\nInformation medium\nLegitimacy\nResistance to change (consumers)\nResistance to change (firms)\nThreat of violence (Mafia attacks)\nLimited moral imagination\n\n\n\n\nMoral intentions and objectives\nNewspapers and lately the website\n✔\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent activities and initiatives\nWebsite, TVs, Posters, newspapers, and magazines\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\n\nList of consumers and firms adhering to the initiative and activist members of the association\nWebsite and meeting with the press\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\n\nBudget & other internal activities\nWebsite\n✔\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitations to join Addiopizzo\nPhysical stickers and internet banners\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\n\nMafia’s attacks against people related to the anti-Mafia movement\nWebsite, newspapers, and magazines\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\nInformation “no-one wants to say”: Mafia’s illegal activities\nWebsite, newspapers, magazines, and conferences\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\nEthical certifications\nStickers\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\nNotes:\n1.This table systematically classifies the types of information that Addiopizzo has made public.\n2.This table is from Table 3, Vaccaro 2012.\n\n\n\nAddiopizzo provided legal aid and psychological support.They also worked with schools to change cultural ideas around pizzo. These actions created a support structure for disclosure, making transparency strategic.\n\n\n\n\nBy disclosing extortion data and embedding resistance in everyday objects, the movement exposed the Mafia’s reliance on fear and silence. It informed and enabled action.\nAddiopizzo shows that dynamic transparency can challenge organised crime. In a situation where official organisations were not working well, it created a system where people could be held responsible. This showed that if people are aware of what is happening, they can stop crime.\nReferences: Addiopizzo.org: https://addiopizzo.org/en/what-we-do/critical-consumption/\nLipari, F., & Andrighetto, G.

Addiopizzo Sticker from Addiopizzo.org (https://addiopizzo.org/en/what-we-do/critical-consumption/)\nEach sticker performed three functions:\n\nSpatial Insurgency Tools: Converting private storefronts into public declarations of resistance, remapping commercial space as anti-Mafia territory.\nViolence Exposure Triggers: Vandalism by Mafia actors turned implicit threats into documented evidence, forcing invisible coercion into legal/political view.\nReal-Time Trust Networks: Sustained sticker visibility created a live “ethical cartography,” enabling consumers to identify safe businesses at a glance.\n\n Fig 4. How stickers work\nFrom 2005 to 2019, Addiopizzo’s members rose from 1,214 entrepreneurs and 13,376 consumers to include large corporations.(see Figure 4, Lipari & Andrighetto, 2020).\n Fig 5. Subscription to Addiopizzo from 2005 until 2019. Source of data comes directly from Addiopizzo dataset. Elaboration of the authors.(Lipari & Andrighetto, 2020)\nIn 2007, the association counted 210 traders and entrepreneurs as members and over 9,000 consumers committed to buying only at shops belonging to the “pizzo-free” list.(Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiopizzo)\nIn practice, it became a low-cost, high-impact governance mechanism driven by disclosure rather than force.\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows its disclosure project breaks down the mafia’s control over the economy. They publicise both the Mafia’s message and their own, to avoid being attacked by the Mafia. The most significant innovation is the transition of the two types of information into visual formats, turning everyday consumption into a means of collective resistance:\nTable 1: Typologies of disclosed information and related issues to be fixed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation typology\nInformation medium\nLegitimacy\nResistance to change (consumers)\nResistance to change (firms)\nThreat of violence (Mafia attacks)\nLimited moral imagination\n\n\n\n\nMoral intentions and objectives\nNewspapers and lately the website\n✔\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent activities and initiatives\nWebsite, TVs, Posters, newspapers, and magazines\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\n\nList of consumers and firms adhering to the initiative and activist members of the association\nWebsite and meeting with the press\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\n\nBudget & other internal activities\nWebsite\n✔\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitations to join Addiopizzo\nPhysical stickers and internet banners\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\n\nMafia’s attacks against people related to the anti-Mafia movement\nWebsite, newspapers, and magazines\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\nInformation “no-one wants to say”: Mafia’s illegal activities\nWebsite, newspapers, magazines, and conferences\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\nEthical certifications\nStickers\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n\n\n\nNotes:\n1.This table systematically classifies the types of information that Addiopizzo has made public.\n2.This table is from Table 3, Vaccaro 2012.\n\n\n\nAddiopizzo provided legal aid and psychological support.They also worked with schools to change cultural ideas around pizzo. These actions created a support structure for disclosure, making transparency strategic.\n\n\n\n\nBy disclosing extortion data and embedding resistance in everyday objects, the movement exposed the Mafia’s reliance on fear and silence. It informed and enabled action.\nAddiopizzo shows that dynamic transparency can challenge organised crime. In a situation where official organisations were not working well, it created a system where people could be held responsible. This showed that if people are aware of what is happening, they can stop crime.\nReferences: Addiopizzo.org: https://addiopizzo.org/en/what-we-do/critical-consumption/\nLipari, F., & Andrighetto, G.

Based on 118 prosecuted cases in Taiwan, the authors compare the effects of Pump-and-Dump and Stabilization strategies. They find that Pump-and-Dump schemes cause sharp price spikes, volatility, and reversals, while Stabilization has milder effects. Although the study offers rare insights into real-world manipulation, its reliance on prosecuted cases may miss undetected schemes. The findings highlight the need for stronger regulation and greater investor caution.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nAnton Gerhard Sonsalla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotion vs. Truth - Why We Fall for Fake News\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blog post explores how emotions influence our susceptibility to fake news. Research reveals that heightened emotional states, whether positive or negative, increase belief in false headlines, while analytical thinking helps discern truth. Experimenters found out that instructing people to rely on emotion leads to greater acceptance of misinformation, whereas reason-based judgments improve accuracy. These findings fit within the broader context of psychology and behavioral economics. The post underscores the importance of pausing to reflect before believing or sharing news, highlighting real-world consequences of misinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 8, 2025\n\n\nFlorin Busca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do People Fall for Health Misinformation?

By adjusting profits just enough to avoid reporting losses, firms can mislead investors and other stakeholders about their true financial performance. The post explains how earnings management works in practice, introduces a widely cited study documenting the prevalence of earnings manipulations, and presents new evidence showing that this pattern continues to affect company reports today. It aims to help readers better understand why a critical eye is essential when interpreting financial reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nIanita Velichkova\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenwashing as Financial Disinformation: Implications for Shareholders and Firm Value\n\n\n\n\n\nThis blog post explores how greenwashing (misleading environmental claims by firms) functions as financial disinformation. Drawing on signalling theory and a recent event-study by Xu et al. (2025), it shows how greenwashing distorts transparency by compromising the accuracy and clarity of corporate signals. The reviewed study finds that markets react negatively to greenwashing news, with especially strong penalties for firms with high ESG reputations. The post argues that greenwashing breaks the trust investors place in sustainability claims and briefly mentions the broader implications for corporate transparency, investor behavior, and firm valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nKonstantin Krüger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenwashing Unwrapped - Consumer Reactions and Brand Risks in Sustainability Marketing\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenwashing has become a widespread corporate practice, from Oatly’s “biggest lifestyle change” slogan to Innisfree’s notorious “paper bottle” scandal. As regulators crack down and consumers grow more critical, the risks of greenwashing are higher than ever. A recent study by Yannopoulou et al. (2024) highlights three distinct consumer reactions to greenwashing - outrage, cautious forgiveness, and nuanced assessment - each with major implications for brands. To survive in this era of heightened scrutiny, companies must embed sustainability into their core operations, not just their marketing. Authenticity and transparency are no longer optional - they’re the only way forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nNoé Schoch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertified confusion - greenwashing in EU’s sustainability auditing\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU is faced with a growing trend of greenwashing as companies increasingly use sustainability labels (ISO-14001, EMAS) while maintaining harmful practices. Testa et al. (2015) examine whether stakeholder pressures drive genuine environmental action or mere certification-seeking. Surveying 232 EMAS-certified firms, they find that shareholders and suppliers push real change, while customers and industry groups incentivize superficial compliance. Quality-focused firms internalize practices, cost-cutters don’t. Yet, without industry-specific analysis or objective performance data (e.g., emissions), the study can’t fully distinguish symbolic from substantive adoption. The core challenge remains: certifications may signal legitimacy, not progress, masking the gap between green claims and actual impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nSaara Heimsch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Rumors Move Billions: What Fake News Does to Stock Prices\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a fake headline move a stock price? This post dives into new research that tracks how markets respond to false stories about publicly listed companies. With real data from the U.S. and EU, the study uncovers surprising patterns in investor behavior and shows why not all fake news is created equal. From instant price drops to lingering effects, this piece unpacks the financial consequences of misinformation and explores what it means for market integrity in the digital age.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\n\nUnathi Zwane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Saying One Thing and Doing Another Is Hurting Your Brand\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen companies make bold claims about doing good — from saving the planet to promoting fairness — but fail to follow through, people notice. This post explores how such mismatches between words and actions lead to what researchers call corporate hypocrisy. Using real examples like Volkswagen and H&M, it explains the different forms this can take, why it matters, and how stakeholders react. Based on the framework by Wagner, Korschun, and Troebs (2020), the post also highlights why understanding public perceptions is crucial for brands that want to build and keep trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 16, 2025\n\n\nValentine Lassagne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking the Pizzo Pact - How Dynamic Transparency Rewired Sicily’s Economy\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article shows how Addiopizzo, a group of Sicilian students, used transparency—not police or politics—to fight the Mafia. Mainly by making public which shops refused to pay protection money, and using stickers to show it on the street, Addiopizzo turned private fear into public resistance. Their simple disclosures rewired how people shopped, what they believed, and how much the Mafia could earn.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nWanqi Dai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Fall for Fake News Because They Fail to Think How Reflecting Beats Partisan Clickbait\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy we fall for partisan fakery? Pennycook & Rand find laziness, not loyalty, to blame. Over 3,400 Clinton and Trump fans judged Facebook-style headlines—real, fake, blue, red — then took the three-item Cognitive Reflection Test. High-CRT readers spotted fakes and withheld shares, whichever side they favored. Viral hoaxes scream implausibility, so a two-second mental check beats them.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nZarina Khisamtullina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Coordinate a State Disinformation Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\nThis blog analyzes how South Korea’s National Intelligence Service coordinated a large-scale disinformation campaign during the 2012 presidential election. By examining timing patterns, content adjustments, and organizational behavior, I uncovers how state agents operated systematically to manipulate public opinion. In the final section, I briefly compares this case to other coordinated disinformation efforts, raising broader questions about how such campaigns are managed.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 18, 2025\n\n\nZhen Yang\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
